Information Retrieval (IR) is a fundamental field in computer science that focuses on the efficient discovery of relevant information from large and unstructured collections of documents. The primary goal of an information retrieval system is to satisfy a user’s information need by identifying documents that best match a given query. Modern IR systems employ various theoretical models, including the Boolean model, the Vector Space Model, and probabilistic models, each offering different ways to represent documents and queries. These techniques form the core of widely used applications such as web search engines, digital libraries, and document management systems.
