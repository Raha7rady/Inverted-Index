Modern search systems rely heavily on ranking algorithms to determine the relative importance and relevance of documents with respect to a user’s query. Instead of relying solely on exact keyword matching, these systems compute relevance scores using statistical and probabilistic techniques. Methods such as Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and BM25 are widely adopted for this purpose. By considering factors like term importance and document distribution, these ranking models provide more accurate and meaningful search results, significantly improving the overall user experience.
