The inverted index is one of the most essential data structures in information retrieval systems. It provides an efficient mapping from each term in the vocabulary to the list of documents in which that term appears, often along with additional information such as term frequency. By organizing data in this way, inverted indexes allow search engines to quickly retrieve relevant documents without scanning the entire document collection. This structure is particularly critical for large-scale systems, where efficiency and fast query response times are key requirements.
